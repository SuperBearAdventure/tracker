# Bug Tracker

Issue tracker for bugs found in *Super Bear Adventure*

> **Warning**
> This issue tracker has been archived. With the introduction of *Discord* forum channels, it has been moved back to the official *Super Bear Adventure Discord* server to ease reporting bugs and moderating reports. From now on, please report your game and translation issues there in the dedicated channel. The invite link is available in the pause menu on *Android* and *iOS* versions, and can also be found on the [official website](https://superbearadventure.com/).

> **Note**
> Bug reports (and feature requests) for *Shicka*, the *Discord* bot, can still be made in the dedicated [repository](https://github.com/SuperBearAdventure/shicka) on *GitHub*. As the code of the bot is open source, contributions are also welcome!

## Description

This is the place where known issues for public beta versions of *Super Bear Adventure* are tracked by the developer. They used to be tracked on [a board](https://trello.com/b/yTojOuqv/super-bear-adventure-bugs) on *Trello* but are progressively moved here.

## Reporting a bug

### Reporting a game bug

If you think you found an issue with the game, there are two places where you can report it.

The main place to report a bug is on the official *Super Bear Adventure* *Discord* server, in the `üêõbug-report` channel. The invite link is available in the pause menu on *Android* and *iOS* versions, and can also be found on the [official website](https://superbearadventure.com/). This is often the relevant place if you are not sure the thing you noticed is a bug, do not know how to reproduce it, or just have a screenshot or a screencast to show. There, you will be able to talk about it with an active community of players that may have experienced the same bug as yours.

If you already gathered most of these details, or if it is more convenient for you, you can report the bug directly here on *GitHub*, by filling the form in the [issues tab](https://github.com/SuperBearAdventure/tracker/issues), or by adding a comment below the relevant (open) issue, if there is one.

Bugs that become well-known and get a sufficient level of detail on *Discord* will eventually be considered confirmed and moved here, if they are not already fixed in the meantime. Please take a look at the `üÜïgame-news` channel, the `üìãknown-issues` channel or directly check the tracker here to be kept informed about the resolved issues.

### Reporting a translation bug

The game is mainly translated by the volunteer contributors from the community. The canonical version of the game is the English one, and other translations are derived from it.

Language issues should only be reported on *Discord*. If you spot any translation bug or any typo in your language, you can directly talk to the translator if you know the person, or post it in the `üêõbug-report` channel otherwise. A list of some known active translators is pinned on the channel for reference purposes.

Unfortunately not all languages have an active translator, so if you want to help the developer translate the game and already found several such bugs, you can ask the developer to give you the permission to edit the relevant translation file in private message.

### Reporting a bug with *Shicka* bot

Bug reports (and feature requests) for the *Discord* bot can be made in the dedicated [repository](https://github.com/SuperBearAdventure/shicka) on *GitHub*. As the code of the bot is open source, contributions are also welcome!

### Attaching screencasts or screenshots

It is very helpful to provide a record of the bug you discovered. *Discord* and *GitHub* both support uploading videos and images, but please notice that the file size is usually capped to 8 MB on the *Discord* server (when not boosted) and currently capped to 10 MB on *GitHub*. Thus, another way to attach a medium file is to host it on a dedicated platform and to share it in your report as a link.

## Requesting a feature

Ideas for features, whether vague or very specific, can be sent on *Discord*, in the `ü§îsuggestions` channel for the game (new outfits, new missions...), or in the `üñ•server-suggestions` channel for general *Discord* requests (new emoji, new channels...) or for *Shicka* bot (new commands, new capabilities...).

If you think your idea is an enhancement or a quality of life improvement for players, and that the current behavior hurts the experience, you can consider it a bug and report it at the relevant place.

## Triage

The [project tab](https://github.com/SuperBearAdventure/tracker/projects/1) provides a classic and user-friendly Kanban view of the general state of the work on bugs that are reported here.

They are triaged as follow:

- "Not bugs" are things that work as intended, that are funny enough to be kept, or that can not be fixed since they are... not bugs, but that are still regularly reported
- "Unconfirmed bugs" are bugs for which not enough is known about, or that may not be in the game anymore, without that having been confirmed
- "Confirmed bugs" are bugs for which it is roughly known how to reproduce them or how they works
- "Work in progress bugs" are bugs that have been worked on, but are known to not be fully fixed
- "Fixed bugs" are bugs that have been actively fixed in a previous or upcoming version of the game

Additionnal labels may be added for a better categorization.
